# Hello! This is my Python Cheat Sheet! This is all original content
# Firstly, "#" Is used to create single-line comments in Python

""" Multi-line comments are done by using 3 quotation marks in a row
this makes commenting easier in paragraph form rather than using a hundred Hashtag comment lines
the triple quotation mark is helpful in this context """

#Python is capable of basic arithmetic 

#Addition 
example_one = 5+5 
print  "5+5 = " + str(example_one)

#Subtraction 
example_two = 100-50 
print "100-50 = " + str(example_two)

#Multiplication
example_three = 5*5 
print "5*5 = " + str(example_three)

#Division 
example_four = 81/9
print "81/9 = " + str(example_four)

#Exponential functions 
example_five = 4**4
print "4**2 =" +str(example_five) 

#Modulus: The Modulus operator is used for remainder division on integers
example_six = 27%5 
print "27%5 = " + str(example_six)

#Data Types: 
#------------------------------------------------------------------

#Varibles - Store a value for later use

#Data types can be strings, which contain letters, numbers, and sybmbols
varible_one = "String"
print "varible_one = " + varible_one
#Data types can be numbers
varible_two = 50
print "varible_two = " + str(varible_two)
#Data types can be boolean values (True/False)
varible_three = True
print "varible_three = " + str(varible_three)

#Strings behave in such a manner where each character is assigned a number, called the index.
